While neuroimaging researchers often prefer simpler formats like NIfTI, clinical imaging is dominated by DICOM. A key challenge with classical DICOM is that it stores each 2D slice in a separate file, resulting in hundreds or thousands of files per seriesâ€”though the newer enhanced DICOM standard addresses this. DICOM also supports various compression methods (transfer syntaxes), adding further complexity. NiiVue provides multiple mechanisms to handle DICOM data effectively.

## Using dcm2niix with NiiVue

[dcm2niix](https://github.com/rordenlab/dcm2niix) is a widely used command-line tool for converting DICOM images to NIfTI. It can be used on the backend for preprocessing, or compiled to WebAssembly (WASM) and bundled as an [npm package](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@niivue/dcm2niix) for frontend use. This enables drag-and-drop DICOM support directly in the browser, as demonstrated in the [niivue-dcm2niix project](https://github.com/niivue/niivue-dcm2niix) which includes a [live demo](https://niivue.github.io/niivue-dcm2niix/).

## DICOM Manifests

Unlike enhanced DICOM, classic DICOM stores a single 2D image per file. Therefore, 3D volumetric data is stored in multiple files. A DICOM manifest is a text file that contains a list of relative URLs of DICOM files. Again, the [niivue-dcm2niix project](https://github.com/niivue/niivue-dcm2niix) provides a [live demo](https://niivue.github.io/niivue-dcm2niix/) for using manifest files. Specifically, it includes a button to load [this manifest file](https://niivue.github.io/niivue-demo-images/dicom/niivue-manifest.txt).
