# Development

All NiiVue development is public on GitHub. The `main` branch represents the most current state of NiiVue. Contributions to NiiVue are encouraged and welcomed. 

## Local Development

The hot-reloadable web page is the most responsive way to test and develop new features in NiiVue. Whenever any core source files are modified, the page at /niivue/packages/niivue/src/index.html automatically reloads to reflect those changes. You can edit this index.html file to load specific datasets or create custom examples that demonstrate new functionality or reproduce issues.

```
git clone git@github.com:niivue/niivue.git
cd niivue
npm install
npm run dev
```

The [API documentation](https://niivue.com/demos/devdocs/classes/Niivue.html) provides many live demos as recipes to illustrate the functionality. If you want to modify these demos, you can run them (though note that this mode is not hot-reloadable so you will have to re-run `npm run demo` after changing the core code).

```
git clone git@github.com:niivue/niivue.git
cd niivue
npm install
npm run demo
```

## Documentation Development

The [primary documentation](https://niivue.com/docs/) uses [Docusaurus](https://docusaurus.io/). The easiest way to enhance this documentation is to use the hot-reloadable mode, where changes in the code are rapidly reflected in the locally hosted web browser pages.

```
git clone git@github.com:niivue/niivue.git
cd niivue
npm install
npm run build:niivue
npm run dev:docs
```

## API Development

NiiVue has a Application Programming Interface (API) that allows developers to use embed into larger projects. The API has its own [API online help](https://niivue.com/demos/devdocs/), with many functions including live demo web pages that provide minimal web pages to showcase functionality.  The code uses [JSDoc](https://jsdoc.app/) annotations.
