# Contribute

All NiiVue development is public on GitHub. The `main` branch represents the most current state of NiiVue. Contributions to NiiVue are encouraged and welcomed.

You are not obligated to share changes made to NiiVue. Its permissive open-source license allows you to modify the code for your own use without redistribution. However, if you do choose to share your modifications, the code must remain compliant with the terms of the license.

NiiVue is currently in a state of rapid development until we get to version `1.0.0`. Therefore, it may be a good idea to check back frequently if you are developing software that relies on NiiVue. NiiVue releases starting with `0` should be considered beta software.

## Using Issues

**All** contributions should start as a new issue on the [NiiVue issue board](https://github.com/niivue/niivue/issues).

By starting a new issue for everything we ping everyone watching the project at the same time, and therefore alerting them to the feature, enhancement request, bug, or question. It also gives everyone a chance to comment on new posts.

## Generating Pull Requests

Create a [Pull Request](https://github.com/niivue/niivue/pulls) to contribute new code to the `main` branch. All PRs must pass automatic regression tests and be reviewed by another developer. You have the option of requesting a specific developer review your contribution.
